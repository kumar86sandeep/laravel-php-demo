							 Do containers require maintenance?

							Shipping containers require low maintenance. A new shipping container going straight into a secure storage use will rarelt need maintenance and hence, we recommend buying a new one if you can justify it.<br>New Containers will barely deteriorate because the material is of high quality and the paint work is exceptional; you can realistically expect a 30-40 year life of a new container used for storage. The hinges and locking bars may require oiling every couple of years but that needs only few minutes. The door seals will degrade but they will last at least ten years depending on conditions and probably over twice as long as that.<br>Used containers require the same regular attention to the doors and also there may be small dents or corroded areas that may need repainting from time to time and possibly even a patch welded on. Painting a shipping container to maintain appearance is quite straight forward but does not need to be done often.

							Yes we do, we have long experience of customizing containers for many uses according to their requires for offices, mess-cabins, control rooms, stores and many bespoke applications.<br>We can readily supply containers with basic modifications – such as unusual sizes, windows fitted, partitions, personnel doors etc. nationally. More unusual or bespoke modifications are carried out in our home area of the Tennessee and this will affect the price when it comes to delivery.

							Yes, very. Shipping containers are made for transporting goods across the oceans – often on decks of ships. They have heavy duty rubber door seals which keep out the elements.<br>Used shipping containers sold into the storage and the re-use market can have damaged door seals or damage to the steel roof or sides but most companies selling used containers will ensure that they are inspected and repaired before they are delivered or released.<br>There are low-grade containers around which have usually been sold and used before and then sold on again. These containers will often be at least 15 to 20 years old and whilst some of this age can be in very good condition there is a risk that there may be corrosion or damage to doors, sides, roof etc. You should be really careful to inspect old containers.<br>There is a huge market for new/used shipping containers and you should expect to pay a fair price for a good container.

						<!-- Question Six-->
						<li>
						<div class="collapsed faq-title" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseSix" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseSix">
							What is best surface for positioning a Container?
							<span class="fa fa-chevron-down fa-1x text-info pull-right"></span>
						</div>
						<div id="collapseSix" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordion">
						  <div class="card-body">
							  It is best to site a container on a dry level surface such as concrete, tarmac or paving but this is not always possible. It follows that a damp, soft and uneven surface is the worst type of surface. It is most important that the surface is level so that the doors open and close correctly.<br>The weight of a shipping container is borne through its corners and therefore spacers such as paving stones or timbers can be placed under the corners to level the container even on very uneven ground where different numbers of paving stones or timbers can be used for each corner.<br>Shipping containers are very versatile and are of very strong construction and will sit satisfactorily even on non-ideal surfaces such as grass for many years.
